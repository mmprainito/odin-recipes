# Recipe Website - Learning Project

Hello, welcome to my first assignment practicing basic HTML knowledge acquired while completing The Odin Project. I built a basic recipe website with a main index page and local links to some of my favorite fall cookie recipes. 

## By completing this project, I have accomplished:

* Created index and recipe html files with proper boilerplate and formatting

* Linked html files together

* Inserted images with alternative text

* Used paragraph elements to provide brief descriptions of the recipes and some of the reasons why I enjoy making them 

* Provided ordered and unordered lists for steps and ingredients

* Added Home page button on recipes to allow users to navigate back to the main page
