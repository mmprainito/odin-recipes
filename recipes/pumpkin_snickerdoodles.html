    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Pumpkin snickerdoodles are the perfect treat for fall, winter, or any time. A chewy cinnamon-sugary 
        delight they're fabulous for holiday gatherings, potlucks, or bake sales. What makes a snickerdoodle
        a snickerdoodle is the crispy crackly outside covering a pillowy soft chewy inside. What makes this 
        one pumpkin is of course the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice used liberally for both the inside
        and outside of the cookie.

        <li>1/2 c. unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3/4 c. light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 c. pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 tsp. cream of tartar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>For the spiced sugar</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the cookie dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the butter, brown sugar, pumpkin puree and
        vanilla until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, cream of tartar, baking soda, 
        salt and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and stir until all the dry ingredients are well mixed. 
        Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the dough is firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350*F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>For the spiced sugar: Stir together the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough into balls, about 2 tablespoons each. Roll each ball in the spiced sugar until well 
        coated and arrange at least 2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cookies are puffed, set around the edges and begin to crack on top, 11 to 13 minutes. 
        Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, 
        about 30 minutes.</li>
